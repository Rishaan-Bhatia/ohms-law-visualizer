Ohm's Law Visualizer

This project uses a simple Python script to show how current changes with resistance based on Ohm's Law (V = IR). I fixed voltage at 10V and plotted how current changes as resistance increases from 1 to 10 ohms.

The code calculates current for each resistance value and plots the results using matplotlib. This helped me better understand the inverse relationship between current and resistance in real circuits.

Included in this project:
- A Python file with the code (ohms_law_visualizer.py)
- A screenshot of the graph showing Current vs Resistance (graph-screenshot.png)
